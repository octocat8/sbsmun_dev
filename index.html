		<p>Dear Delegates,<br>It is my honor and privilege to welcome you to the 4th edition of Step by Step School’s Model United Nation. </p>
		<p>A Model United Nations Conference presents an opportunity to delegates and journalists to transition from being national to global citizens as they observe, contemplate and voice their thoughts on real world problems. It is occasion to redefine political ideals, conceptualise abstract ideas and incorporate diverse belief systems to negotiate and propose resolutions.</p>
		<p>SBSMUN2018 with its motto<em> Peace Through Dialogue,</em> hopes to inculcate a commitment towards peace-building in tomorrow’s citizens. This alone can make all agendas of development, real. I hope that the course of these three days represents a transition for each participant. A transition from an individual committed to a portfolio, serving the best interest of their countries to an ideal world citizen acting in the best interests of humanity.</p>
		<p>This Model United Nations Conference gives an opportunity to consider problems that confound even the most experienced diplomats. The agendas ranging from the brutal Vietnam War to the unjustified and illicit overexploitation of African resources or the water disputes in our country pose multidimensional problems.</p>
		<p>Within the cause of a problem lies its most viable solution. The future lies in your hands delegates.<strong> Rewrite, Reimagine and Recreate</strong>.</p>

        <div class="right">
          <p><em>"You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you."<br>- Leon Trotsky (1879-1940)</em></p>
          <p>This statement couldn’t possibly hold truer than at this moment in time. With instances of violence and civil war engulfing significant parts of the planet, the prospect of peace seems far from our reach. </p>
	  <p>Model United Nations conferences, contrary to popular belief, don’t simply exist to offer solutions to the various conflicts surrounding us. More importantly, they bring to our attention the complications behind <em>how</em> such incidents arise and help us realize<em> why</em> they are not quite as easy to contain as it may seem.</p>
	  <p>True to the spirit of SBSMUN, this edition of the conference recognizes and in fact encourages the importance of the responsible usage of free speech. As author George Orwell said,<em> “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear,” </em>and it is precisely this that we advocate as a conference. The right to, and  the power to speak for a particular stance, without fear of judgement or persecution is one that SBSMUN2018 acts as a platform for. It is for you, as delegates, or members of the press, to use this power judiciously.</p>
          <p>On that note, it is an honour for me to welcome each one of you to the Fourth edition of SBSMUN. I am confident that our array of committees and agendas, ranging from the resource security and management in the Less Economically Developed Countries to the war cabinets of militaries divided by ideology, will keep each participant absorbed and stimulate a high level of critical thinking.</p>
          <p>Good Luck!</p>

	      <p>What I believe the world needs most from the press, is a reminder of the capacity of compassion that humans share. Despite war, violence and conflicts, the idea of unity is so vital that it transcends political boundaries. </p>
	      <p>Members of the Fourth Estate, it is time to embark upon a journey to revive, to strengthen, to inform and lastly, to unite. SBSMUN2018 offers this opportunity to all young journalists, cartoonists and photo-journalists.  </p>
	      <p>History is witness to the transformative possibilities of journalism- journalists have fought censorship and oppression to give a voice to every <em>voice</em>. </p>
	      <p>Unfortunately, it seems that we are now enveloped by our differences and beliefs so completely that we are blinded. We are blinded to the cruelty that plagues so many lives. We are blinded to the savagery that we often end up partaking in. Shadows of our intolerance cloud our conscience and rationality.</p>
	      <p>Thus, as members of the Fourth Estate, it is upon us to revive and reinforce universal interconnectedness. Every platform available must be used to not only break free from bigoted and regressive state policies but to also propel mankind on the path towards benevolence. We must encourage countries to extend help to each other and to aid citizens from across the world come to come together in international movements that struggle for a better world. We must restore journalism back to its true form, free from sensationalism and empty words </p>
